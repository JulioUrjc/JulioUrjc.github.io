 $ code .
 ```

## Step 3

 Open the files using VSCode and edit _config.yml and edit with your details:


```
    _config.yml file - replace with your own details
    _posts - Add your blog posts here
    _includes - You can replace the contents of the files with your data. (contains widgets)
    _assets/img - Add all your images here
```

## Step 4

 Install the development requirements:

    2.[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
    3.[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

```
